Variational Bayes-Hidden Markov model (VB-HMM) analysis programs:

Kenji Okamoto and Yasushi Sako, RIKEN
revised: 2016.03.24

System Requirements:
  VB-HMM softwares can be built on darwin or linux operating system.

  GNU Scientific Library (GSL) must be installed to build softwares.
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Build:
  Type the following line on command-line to build softwares.

    make [command]

  Avilable [command] is as follows:
    ts        : to build VB-HMM-TS (vbHmmTs)
    tsFret    : to build VB-HMM-TS-FRET (vbHmmTsFret)
    pc        : to build VB-HMM-PC (vbHmmPc)
    pcFret    : to build VB-HMM-PC-FRET (vbHmmPcFret)
    gauss     : to build VB-HMM-Gauss (vbHmmGauss)
    gaussInt  : to build VB-HMM-Gauss for SM-Intensity (vbHmmGauss)
    gaussDiff : to build VB-HMM-Gauss for Diffusion (vbHmmGauss)
    template  : to build template VB-HMM (vbHmm_template)
    all       : to build all above
    [blank]   : same as 'all'
    clean     : delete binary files

First Step:
  On Unix/Linux terminal, in the directory of source files, type

    make tsFret

  to build VB-HMM-TS-FRET fostware.
  In order to execute, type, for example,

    vbHmmTsFret 2 20 5 1000 1e-10 D-data A-data

  where paramters mean:
    try NoS (number of states) from 2 to 20
      (if maximum of lower bound is found, NoS up to +2 is analyzed)
    repeat 5 analysis at each NoS with changing initial conditions
    calculation continues to 1000 iteration at maximum
      even if calculation does not converges
    calculation ends if lower bounds gets lower than 1e-10
      (smaller value make calculation converges well
       but takes longer time)
    D-data : file name for donor time stamp data
    A-data : file name for acceptor time stamp data

    data file format for VB-HMM-TS-FRET software:
      binary file of 32bit unsigned integer
      1st data : tick frequency
      2nd data- : time stamp of each photon in unit of ticks

  Gauss models are adapted to global analysis.  If multiple data files
  are given, global analysis is automatically activated.  Parameters are
  optimized commonly to all data, while state transition trajectories are
  optimized for individual trajectories.
