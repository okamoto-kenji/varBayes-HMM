Variational Bayes-Hidden Markov model (VB-HMM) analysis programs:
Python version.

Kenji Okamoto and Yasushi Sako, RIKEN
revised: 2015.09.27

System Requirements:
  Python Ver. 3

  The following Libraries must be installed:
    NumPy
    SciPy

Available Model:
  Gaussian model

Execution:
  In order to execute, type, for example,

    python vbHmmGauss.py 2 20 5 1000 1e-10 datafile

  where paramters mean:
    try NoS (number of states) from 2 to 20
      (if maximum of lower bound is found, NoS up to +2 is analyzed)
    repeat 5 analysis at each NoS with changing initial conditions
    calculation continues to 1000 iteration at maximum
      even if calculation does not converges
    calculation ends if lower bounds gets lower than 1e-10
      (smaller value make calculation converges well
       but takes longer time)
    datafile : file name for data

    data file format for VB-HMM-TS-FRET software:
      text file containing a value per line.

Known Problems:
• Just translated from C version.  Not optimized for Python.
• Results differs from C version.
• Much slower (> 100 times) then C version.
